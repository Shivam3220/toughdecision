    <h2>who wins on social?</h2>
    <p id="q">Lay's is a brand of potato chips, as well as the name of the company that founded the chip brand in the United States. The brand has also sometimes been referred to as Frito-Lay because both Lay’s and Fritos are brands sold by the Frito-Lay company, which has been a wholly owned subsidiary of PepsiCo since 1965.

        Frito-Lay primarily uses the brand name "Lay's" in the United States, and uses other brand names in certain other countries: Walkers in the UK and Ireland; Smith's in Australia; Chipsy in Egypt[1] and the West Balkans;[2] Tapuchips in Israel;[3] Margarita in Colombia; Sabritas in Mexico; and, formerly, Hostess in Canada.</p>

I am an Indian and the flavour addicted to this magic masala flavour is exactly the same how the Indians cook. I would suggest every one to at least taste one bite nor he/she will surely be missing this flavour</p></td>
    <td><p id="g">The flavour of American style cream onion is the best flavour I like. it is very tasty and it's flavour is very tasty. I feel that I can eat 100 packs of lays of this flavour. it's flavour is very creamy and cheesy and the flavour is awesome. in one word it is very delicious and can also be termed as fantastic!</p></td>
<td><p id="y">The undistracted flavour of a good potato chip with the right amount of salt and almost no greasiness. I can hog on it as a midnight snack, as soon as I get up and basically just anytime of the day.</p></td>    
<td><p id="r">Blast of flavors in one's mouth. Just can't stop with 1.Experience the tangy flavours and savoury spices of these chips from Lay’s flirt with your taste buds. These chips are made using fresh, high-quality potatoes that are cooked to perfection in vegetable edible oils, and then seasoned rightly for that perfect balance of flavours and crispiness.</p></td>
